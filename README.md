# CleanDataAssignment
Repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course's Assignment

# Updating the README.md File for  Submission
There is only one .R script used in this assignment which contains only one method. This isn't best programming practices, but the script works just fine. The code is heavily commented and should adequately explain what is happening. Abstractly, this is the script's workflow:

1. Get all of the data ready from the files
2. Fix and prepare the data, including casting, rbind(), and aggregating
3. Write the final output to a file titled "clean_data_assignment_output.txt"
